    <div class="standOut">What surprised me most</div>
    <p class="text">What surprised me the most about Human Skills learning is that it was part of the course! I didn't expect a tech course to be in touch with mindfulness, communication and understanding learning strengths. I think it can be helpful in the tech field because of the change in employment requirements in the last decade. I studied veterinary nursing for 2 years and a key part of the course was trying to create graduates that are good at their job but also good at being a point of connection between an owner's animal and their pets' health. This can also be transferred to the tech industry.

    <div class="standOut">Three ego checks</div>
    <ul class="text">
      <li>I get distracted by extending my knowledge in less useful areas</li>
      <li>Sometimes I "just figure it out alone" and that slows me down</li>
      <li>I care way too much about my website styling</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="standOut">Why empathy matters</div>
    <p class="text">It's the difference between being a coding robot and someone people actually want to work with. Empathy helps you build things real users need, not just what's cool to code.</p>
    
    <div class="standOut">The awkward bits</div>
    <p class="text">Admitting when I'm lost instead of pretending I get it. Also the reflection exercises feel cringe at first.</p>
    
    <div class="standOut">Why we bother with this</div>
    <p class="text">Because anyone can learn to code but devs who can communicate and collaborate get hired. Especially with AI booming, tech's changing too fast to rely on just technical skills.</p>
    
    <div class="standOut">Waste of time?</div>
    <p class="text">I used to think it was. Sometimes still feel like some exercises can be. But sacrificing 10% of coding time to get better at communication is a good trade off.</p>
