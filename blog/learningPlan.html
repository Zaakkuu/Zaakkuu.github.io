    <ul>
<li>What is your long term goal or career pathway?
I’m hoping to join a startup company at the end of DevAcademy, I had a talk with Brody Nelson before I started this course and he said that they are looking for front/backend developers with either a computer science degree or a course with devacademy. I also talked with Ahmed who was a previous student at dev academy and he pushed me to go for it.
 </li>
 <li> A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
I am able to pickup on concepts relatively fast and am able to show my understanding in different ways. I struggle with finalising my work because i have high standards for myself
 </li>
  <li>  What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?	
Working with others on creative projects is difficult for me because I like to have creative control/freedom 	
 </li>
   <li>  A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
  </li>
    <li> What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
I like structured work chunks which work well with the dev academy structure in the handbook. Going from each tech chunk to the other and finishing off with emotional intelligence + reflections.
This week I already had to manage with work buildup and it did really get to me in the last few days, but I kept on pushing myself to continue working as hard as I could when I had the time.
 </li>
     <li>  A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
If it’s something I have forgotten, that is surface level information I will just ask deepseek, for example I was stuck on the differences between div main body etc and i got a quick answer that reminded me. Otherwise if im troubleshooting my code I would ask a facilitator
 </li>
<li> A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
I don’t know yet. I suppose support and help when asked for it?</li>
<li> Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
I drop my partner off at work, at 5PM on most days (her roster shifts around each week) and pick her up anywhere from 9PM to 12PM. Otherwise im not very busy except for looking after my cat
</li>
Your Facilitator will review your Learning Plan at the end of this Sprint.</ul></p>
