  <p class="text">
    <ol>
        <li>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
I used to work at a vet clinic as a vet nurse assistant. One day my best friends mum called me saying she was going to bring their cat into the clinic today because he had shown signs of declining health.  The cat was called clawss and was a stray that the family had adopted and made part of their family. The vets examined him and determined he was living in pain because his belly had filled up with liquid. There were 2 options, put him down and end his pain, or spend upwards of $800 to get him xrayed and identify the problem but still likely have to put him down because of the severity of it. The mum asked me and I said the first option would probably be the most humane and stress free way for claws to end his happy life. This decision battled on my morals as a friend and a training professional, ofcourse knowing specifically what caused the liquid buildup would give peace of mind but most liekly  wouldn’t change the outcome. The decision still sits with me because I loved that cat and i question if the money was worth the extremely small chance of it not being a fatal condition.
</li>
<li>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.
My dad is a inspiration for my morals because I feel he is similar to me in his workstyle but he is able to get on with his work and stay focused longer than me.
</li>
<li>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.
I am a quick learner and have been around computers for as long as I remember so I feel my experience/familiarity will (and has) come in handy
</li>
<li>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?
Im not sure what this question is trying to ask by limitation on learning.
</li>
<li>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
Back in my final year of school, we had this big physics project. My group was solid except for one guy who just... didn’t do his part. He was supposed to handle the data analysis, but deadlines came and went with nothing from him. At first, we tried being patient. But when it got down to the wire, my other teammate and I just split his work between us and cranked it out. We presented without him, and the teacher ended up grading him separately after we explained what happened. 
What I would do know: I’d call a group meeting way earlier and say, "Hey, we’re stuck what’s going on?" Maybe he was lost and too embarrassed to ask for help. Back then, I just wanted to avoid conflict, but now I see that clear, early communication could’ve fixed things without resentment.
